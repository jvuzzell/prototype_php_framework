API Gateway Order of Operations 

Solution - replace JWT Management Object... 
    - Canabalize features into Environment Config: 
        - Request Data 
        - Request Method
        - Request Header 
        - Request Authorization 


1. Initialize environment configurations (environment_config)
    - Gateway specific configs 
    - Shared configs 
        - Environment config object
            - URL/URI [x]
            - Directories [x]
            - Clients [x]
            - Command Line Flag [x]
            - (Tentative) (Get these from request or allow to be set via local API call)
                - Request Data [x]
                - Request Method [x]
                - Request Header [x]
                - Request Authorization [x] 
2. Get Fingerprint (fingerprint_manager)
    - 
3. Route (api_router)
    - Check for cached routes [x]
        - Create new cache if necessary
    - Is fingerprint required?
    - Authorize
        -  Is fingerprint authorized to use this endpoint?
5. Resolve (api_resolver)
    - Input 
        - Validate
    - Output
        - Structure output


NOTE: 
- API Gateway must completely dependent on Environment_config Object 
- JWT Manager should be converted to Fingerprint Manager
